							<p>Hi, I'm Cornelius. I'm from Memphis, Tennessee. If you bump into me around there, you can call me Neil. I'm the first person in my family to graduate from college, the first to graduate from law school, and the first to leave a legal career behind befoer starting it to make awesome stuff and tell awesome stories.</p>

							<p> Journey to Code </p>

							<p>During the start of my second semester in law school, I organized a team to build an app to help people receive better legal service. This project transitioned into another project, called Fluttr,premised on helping people crowdsource creative contributions on projects and ideas. During this time, I didn't really touch code. Instead, I recruited other developers to the team and kind of served as a project manager. Early on Saturday mornings, I would travel to Philadelphia from New York City to be with my team. And late on every weeknight, I'd be up, doing everything I could to ensure that we were successful. That meant	learning how to code a bit to fix small details. During this time, I started to imagine leaving the legal path entirely to make awesome stuff. When the project crashed at the end of my second year, I battled depression. I felt that I let my teammates down as a leader. Our team motto was to "Be Great" but despite giving it everything I had, I couldn't do enough to help ensure we lived up to it as a team. I just wasn't good enough. I felt like such a failure. In retrospect, I think at the time, it also felt like the opportunity to pursue my passion, to make awesome stuff, was slipping away. What helped me bounce back was realizing that my journey did not have to end here. I decided that I was just getting started.</p>

							<p>I spent my last year of law school learning more and more about code. After I graduated from law school, I turned down an offer to work for Microsoft,to spend more time coding instead. I joined a bootcamp called Epicodus,where over the course of three months I learned how to build responsive web applications using javascript and javascript frameworks, PHP, HTML, and CSS. During this time, I also learned behavior driven development, pair programming, and perhaps most importantly, how to quickly pick up new tech stacks. </p>

<p>I love to build awesome stuff and tell awesome stories. I want to be a part of teams that make awesome stuff and tell awesome stories. If you have something in mind or want to exchange ideas, feel free to contact. </p>
